Autark is a crypto-anarchic `DevSecOps` framework for more secure, and self-sovereign frontend deployments; embracing immutable, decentralized, and multi-party-verified frontend governance through Safe + ENS + IPFS.

# Problem First

Modern `DevOps` pipelines have become too automated, too centralized, and too trusting.

A single compromised developer or **CI/CD** token can silently push malicious frontend code to production — within minutes — across millions of users. Here, the weakest link remains the deployment pipeline.

**AUTARK** exists to contribute to fixing this.

It reintroduces multi-party verification, cryptographic immutability, and decentralized governance into the deployment lifecycle. We are turning `DevOps` into `DevSecOps`, and `DevSecOps` into a **meta-governance layer for frontends**.

> **AUTARK** enforces a new rule where nothing goes live without consensus, and once live, new (as well as previous) version lives forever.

# Overview

Autark [/ô′tär″k/] derived from [autarky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autarky), meaning self-sufficiency; is a crypto-anarchic  framework for frontend deployments.

It transforms how teams ship code by introducing a meta-governance layer for frontends. A trustless, multi-sig process that enforces security at the developer layer while preserving decentralization.

## Core Principles

1. **ENFORCE BETTER **
*Every deployment passes through explicit multi-party verification, and immutable cryptographic sealing.*

2. **REJECT CENTRALIZED GATEKEEPERS**
*No single-point of failure, no opaque CI/CD pipelines.*

3. **META-GOVERNANCE LAYER FOR FRONTENDS**
*A decentralized review `dev` board encoded through Safe multisig decides what becomes production.*

4. **CRUCIAL PART OF THE  PIPELINE**
*Autark integrates directly into **GitHub Actions**, enforcing multi-sig approval checkpoints before any code can go live.*

# How it Works?

Autark replaces “trust” with verifiable processes and cryptographic finality:

> Each release becomes an immutable record, and an auditable artifact of a more secure frontend versioning deployment.
